-- QUIZ: Arithmetic Operators

-- Using the `orders` table

/* 
1. Create a column that divides the `standard_amt_usd` by the 
`standard_qty` to find the unit price for standard paper for each order.
Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the `id` and 
`account_id` fields.
*/

SELECT 	order_id,
		account_id,
		standard_amt_usd/standard_qty AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

/*
Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from 
poster paper for each order. You will need to use only the columns 
that end with `_usd`. (Try to do this without using the total column).
Include the `id` and `account_id` fields. NOTE - you will be thrown an 
error with the correct solution to this question. This is for a 
division by zero. You will learn how to get a solution without an 
error to this query when you learn about CASE statements in a later
section. For now, you might just add some very small value to your 
denominator as a work around.

SELECT 	order_id,
		account_id,
		poster_amt_usd/(standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd) AS post_per_revenue
FROM orders;
